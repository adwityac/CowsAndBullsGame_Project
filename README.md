## Introduction

In Cows and Bulls game, the player needs to guess a 4-digit number with no duplicate digits. The program generates a random 4-digit number for the player to guess. The player has a limited number of tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of bulls (correct digit in the correct position) and cows (correct digit in the wrong position). The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly within the given number of tries or runs out of attempts.

## Algorithm

1. If guessed digit is in the correct position in the secret code:
   - Increment bulls count.

2. If guessed digit is in the secret code but in the wrong position:
   - Increment cows count.

3. If the guess does not contain any digits from the secret code:
   - Consider it an incorrect guess.

4. If the player correctly guesses the entire secret code:
   - Declare it a winning guess.
